    "What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",

    "It is essentially a reusable piece of code that can take input arguments, process them, and return output.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a function call is the act of invoking or executing a function in order to make it perform its intended task.\n",
    "When a function is called, the control is transferred to the function, and it starts executing from the first line of code within the function.\n",

    "What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",

    "Exception handling allows you to catch and handle errors that occur during the execution of your program, so that your program can recover from the error and continue running.\n",
